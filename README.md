# LinguaLeap
LinguaLeap is a language learning platform for universities that enables structured peer conversations using level-based matching and AI feedback. Designed to integrate into courses, it helps students practice speaking consistently while giving institutions measurable learning outcomes.

Students are matched with peers based on proficiency using an ELO-style rating system and participate in structured conversation sessions. After each session, the platform provides AI-powered feedback to support reflection on fluency, vocabulary use, and areas for improvement. For instructors, LinguaLeap enables measurable tracking of participation and speaking progress that can integrate into existing course workflows.

Project Context:

This repository contains a product prototype developed as part of a university product design and engineering course (CS177). The goal of the project was to explore how conversation-based language learning could be better integrated into academic environments, particularly universities where speaking practice is difficult to scale.

Not all features described here are fully implemented. Some components represent product direction or design intent rather than production-ready functionality.

Current Features:
Proficiency-based peer matching using an ELO-style rating system
Structured conversation sessions (live or in-person workflows)
AI-generated post-conversation feedback
Student-facing progress indicators
Instructor- and course-oriented analytics concepts

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React + TypeScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Build tooling: Vite
Icons/UI: Lucide React
Backend / data layer: prototype-level (not production integrated)

Repository Status:

This is an early-stage prototype focused on:
Validating conversation-based learning workflows
Exploring matching logic and feedback UX
Supporting product discovery and user testing
The codebase is not intended for production deployment.

Future Work:

Improved mobile support
More robust proficiency modeling
Instructor dashboards and LMS integrations
Safety, moderation, and scheduling infrastructure
